    For my capstone project, I will be designing and building a web application that will be useful for those looking to rent an apartment and those who lease their properties. The main functions of the application will be to allow potential tenants to submit rental applications, landlords to setup properties for lease, record rent payments, and exiting tenants to calculate their upcoming rent payments.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This project originated in response to the requirements of the Capstone project for Maryville's Masters of Software Development program.
My parents have multiple rental properties and it can be challenging at times to keep track of all the applications, tenant payments, etc.
The application is expected to address a few of those issues.
